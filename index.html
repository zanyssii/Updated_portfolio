                    <br><br>
                    No, there is no bears really walking the streets in Russia. Is one of the most common stereotypes about Russia among foreigners is that bears walk the streets of Russian cities.
                     <br><br>
                 But i'm not about that. 
                 I'm about who i'm and how i end up here and what i like to do.
                  
                    <br><br>
                 I graduated with Master's Degree as engineer-designer from Moscow State University of Printing Arts.
                 When i was attening the University i fell in love for technology. And i had done some courses in computer science. Since then i developed my career goals and i decided to take Coding Bootcamp courses to improve my knowledges and skills realated to this field.

                 <br><br>

                 I moved to US 3 years ago.

                There is nothing unusual in my story.
                <br><br>
                Once as usual we communicated with my friend who lives in California. At this time i was looking for advanced training at one of the universities In Germany that collaborated with the university which i graduated from. 
                But my German left much to be desired. 
                So somehow he persuaded me to come to UTAH. I'm a wanderlust and i lived in couple countries before so i didn't think much before accepting this tempting offer. 
                 <br><br>
                 And since I have a strong desire to travel and explore the world and i'm dreaming one day laying on the beach and developing websites.
